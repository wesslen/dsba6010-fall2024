# Video Reflections

Throughout the course, you'll watch and respond to several key videos that explore different aspects of LLM development and deployment. These reflections help build understanding of current trends, challenges, and opportunities in the field.

Each reflection requires a 100-200 word response addressing specific discussion prompts. Responses should demonstrate critical thinking and personal insight rather than just summarizing the content.

## General Guidelines
- Ground responses in personal experiences and observations
- Engage critically with the presented ideas
- Consider cross-domain applications
- Draw connections to other courses and current events
- Respond thoughtfully to peer discussions
