# Case Study Discussions

Students will be assigned to project groups and one of four specific roles:
- AI Product Manager
- Data/Prompt Engineer
- AI Application Developer
- LLMOps Developer

In addition to your [project group](../project/roles), you will be assigned a 2nd case study presentation group where you'll present/lead class discussion twice in the semester.

*Example: For Student 11, they will be in Project Group 3 with Students 9, 10 and 12. They will be assigned the role of AI Application Developer. Student 11 will also be in the Article Presentation Group with Student 3 and 7 for the article presentations/discussions.*

## Presentation Requirements

If you are scheduled to present/lead the discussion, you are to present the 3 required articles. Presenters are expected to facilitate a class discussion for 45-60 minutes on all three articles with accompanying presentation materials ‚Äì slides, handouts, demos.

Feel free to be creative with how to convey the discussion. For presentation materials, focus on **quality rather than quantity** as the goal is for an interesting class discussion, not a full lecture. Avoid slides with lots of bullet points that don't facilitate a discussion (e.g., reuse images more often than just bullet points). Focus on high level takeaways.

Remember: you're not expected to be perfect. The intent is for you to learn how to facilitate a discussion around the case studies as you learn. You are not expected to know everything about the readings. You can also raise questions or things you don't understand. We're all here to learn together.

## Attendance Policy

‚ö†Ô∏è In-person attendance is critical. If you cannot make your scheduled week you are required to record a 10 minute video on one of the articles. 
- Excused absences will be expected to provide the video by class time
- Unexcused absences will have a 50% penalty and have one week to submit
- After one week, the student will receive 0

Given that the focus is a lively in-class discussion, students are not permitted to use Zoom in lieu of in-class presentation. Therefore, if you can't make the class in person, you should best prepare a recorded video.

## Students Not Presenting

If you are not presenting for that week, you are responsible for required reading (typically 3 articles) and coming to class prepared for every week.

üí° Quizzes will be based on readings for each class. Quizzes will be unannounced, paper, and five multiple choice questions taken after break and before case study discussion. They will be in four of the eight case study classes. Your lowest score will be dropped.
